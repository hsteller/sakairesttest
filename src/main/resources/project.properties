# credentials to create a session if there's no session cookie yet,
# i.e. we will talk to Sakai as this user
auth.username=admin

# if you use SSO, you probably want to copy&paste an existing session cookie  
# instead of providing a username+password
auth.sessionCookieValue=
# For example: 
#auth.sessionCookieValue=8b92a2b9-bc40-4151-8d42-b69bfebd1193.tomcat-local


# in theory, one could configure the application server to use something different..
